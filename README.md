Cloud computing is one of the most promising technologies and its benefits are 
enormous. The real-world situations where cloud computing is at stake and the ways in 
which industries have reduced these threats are discussed. 
To address the risk of data security in the cloud environment, the ability of users to 
identify true and false is very important. The biggest problem in cloud computing is 
related to establishing trust between servers and clients. And any internal access to cloud 
hosting data from vendor data needs to be considered as unauthorized access. Users do 
no longer understand where their records is stored and there may be a robust perception 
that users have lost manage in their information after it has been uploaded to the cloud. 
To allow customers to govern access to their facts saved within the public cloud, 
suitable access control policies and tactics are required. Accessibility policies should 
restrict access to data only to data owners.
